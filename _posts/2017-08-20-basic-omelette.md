<!-- Instructions -->

1. Using a ceramic pan, preheat at 7/9 on an electric stove.
2. Once the pan is feeling toasty, if you hover your hand about an inch above it, add a small amount of butter to the pan.
3. Once the butter is starting to bubble, pour in the eggs.
4. After about 30 seconds, start adding half of your shredded cheese to half of the omelette.
5. Add your mushrooms, bacon, and spinach (or whatever toppings you want) evenly on the same half as the cheese.
6. Add the rest of your cheese on top
7. Tilt the pan back and forth periodically to see how runny the eggs are.
   > *If the pan is too hot, you'll see/smell smoke and hear loud sizzling. If too cold, you won't hear or smell much.*
8. Once about half of the eggs are cooked, and half runny, fold the omelette in half. This usually takes about 4-5 minutes.
   > *Usually you need to fold the omelette further than you think to actually get it folded in half.*
9. Once you've got the Maillard reaction you want on the bottom, flip the omelette for about 1-2 minutes to get it on the other side and immediately plate it.
   > *Depending on the pan's temperature, you may already have the Maillard reaction on both sides. If that is the case, plate it right away.*
