<!-- Prep -->

- Trim the fat if using brisket, then cut the beef into 2-inch chunks. Pat dry, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
- Heat oil in a heavy-based pot over high heat. Add beef in batches and brown well all over. Remove onto plate. Repeat with the remaining beef.
- (Optional) If you have a bottle/can size of Guinness that isn't a multiple of 14.9 oz, deglaze the pan with whatever is leftover.

<!-- Instructions -->

1. Lower the heat to medium. If the pot is looking dry, add oil.
2. Cook garlic and onion for 3 minutes until softening.
3. Add flour and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.
4. Add Guinness, chicken broth/stock and tomato paste. Mix well (to ensure flour dissolves well), add bay leaves and thyme.
5. Return beef into the pot (including any juices). Liquid level should just cover.
6. Cover, lower heat so it is bubbling gently. Cook for 2 hours. The beef should be pretty tender after the 2 hours.
7. Add the mushrooms, carrots and celery. Depending on how soft you want the vegetables to be, add them 15 minutes earlier.
8. Remove the lid, then simmer for a further 30 â€“ 45 minutes or until the beef falls apart at a touch, the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.
9. Skim off fat on the surface, if desired. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove bay leaves and thyme.
