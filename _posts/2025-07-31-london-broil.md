<!-- Prep -->

- Remove the top round from its package and trim the fat and any tough tendons
- Score the meat in a diamond pattern on the top and bottom (see picture)
- Add the olive oil, lime juice, shoyu, pepper, rosemary, and garlic to a ziplock along with the top round to marinade
- Place the ziplock in the frige for 12 hours.
  > *Don't marinade for longer than 12 hours or the texture will get weird*
- Preheat a cast iron to medium-high heat with avocado oil (or your favorite high smoke-point oil)

<!-- Instructions -->

1. Sear the top round for approximately 5–6 minutes on each side
2. When the internal temperature reaches your desired doneness, remove from the cast iron.
3. Allow the beef to rest for 12 minutes and serve with lime slices and finishing salt.
